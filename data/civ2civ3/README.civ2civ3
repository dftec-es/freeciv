Civ2Civ3 Earth Ruleset for Freeciv v2.6 (Updated 08-Sep-2017)
============================================================

civ2civ3_earth is a fork of the ruleset civ2civ3 (included in freeciv v2.6). This "earth" pack introduces some of the changes planned for future versions of civ2civ3, allowing players to test them before they are available in the next freeciv releases. It also includes a world map scenario, adapted to be played with these rules.


OBJECTIVES:
-----------
- The main purpose is to get a gameplay more similar to civ3, keeping the combat system from civ2.
- Reduced micromanagement as much as possible. Don't be afraid by the amount of changes, I think this ruleset is easier to learn than classic rules, and it is designed so there is not a big disadvantage when you do not play optimally. I hope both rookies and experienced players can enjoy it.
- Removed the rules that allowed a sudden boost. The result should be a simpler and more linear development of your cities, and a slower paced gameplay. With governments that keep a similar balance along the different ages, and smoother effects of terrains, units, buildings and wonders.
- All the new rules have been adapted so AI can play with them, and to avoid possible exploits by human players.

I wish to keep it updated and to improve it with the comments from the players.


INFO:
-----
- Help texts have been updated (mainly buildings and wonders), so the info showed ingame already takes into account the changed rules. Note that some graphical tables from the manual will not match (mainly terrains and governments), so better use the tables in this Readme as reference.
- I suggest new players to start a game with 6 players or so, AI skill level Normal, and default ruleset options (small continental map with 100 land tiles per player). This way AI will progress at similar pace as real history.
- For challenging games, you may place several AI players in the same team. For example, one team with 5 AIs together against you.
- Cheating AI level was adjusted for these rules, I suggest experienced players to use it.
HARD AI (no limit to tax rates): +20% Science, Luxury, Gold and Production, +20 AI love, +20% Veteran chance, +20% Bribe and Incite costs, -20% Pollution.
CHEATING AI (limited tax rates): +40% Science, Luxury, Gold and Production, +40 AI love, +40% Veteran chance, +40% Bribe and Incite costs, -20% Pollution.

The following is a full list of changes compared to classic ruleset...


CORE CHANGES:
-------------
- No "Rapture Grow" (celebration only causes additional Trade per tile, same as civ3). Foodbox readjusted to keep a constant city growth.
- Settlers cost 2 population (as in civ3). This way, the number of tiles worked in the original city are reduced by 2, equal to the number of tiles worked in the newly created city.
- Allowed 1 trade route per city (2 after the discovery of The Corporation). Trade routes spread the bonuses of special resources. Removed the one time revenues, and halved the ongoing revenues. It is not possible to create trade routes with foreign cities unless they are allies (or on your team).
- Every unit pays some kind of upkeep cost. Under some governments, this upkeep is changed from Shields to Gold (similar to civ3).
- A city can support as many units (with upkeep of Food) as its population size (min 4, max 20). Additional units cause waste of Food. If the city shrinks due to starvation, one of those extra units will be disbanded.
- Increased by one the number of veterancy levels, with effects: 100% (green), 125% (regular), 150% (veteran), 175% (hardened) and 200% (elite). Engineers only 3 levels: 100% (beginner), 125% (seasoned), and 150% (senior). Units lose one veteran level when upgraded.
- Enabled tired attack: units that attack with less than a single move point will have their attack power reduced accordingly. If they have 2/3 movement points, they will attack with 2/3 strength. If they have 1/3 movement points, they will attack with 1/3 strength.
- Unlimited movement on rails delayed to Maglev (available with Superconductors). Movement bonus on Railroads x6, on Roads x3, on Rivers x3 (non diagonal).
- Added Fort and Airstrip bases, required before you can build Fortress or Airbase, respectively. It prevents the construction of full bases in one single turn. The bases no longer protect full stacks from being killed when one unit is defeated.
- Specialists output reduced to 2 (same as civ2). There are wonders that increase it to 3 for all players.
- The cost of each tech is equal to the number of steps needed to get the tech (Tech Cost = Base Cost * Number of Parents). It is a linear formula more similar to civ2, and it fits better the new reduced bonuses from Trade and Science.
- Tech upkeep assigned to cities: some Science is required from each city to maintain a given technological level. The upkeep grows from 0 during the middle ages, up to 10 research points per city when the whole tech tree was researched.
- No holes allowed in tech tree. To acquire a tech you must know its prerequisites, and you cannot lose a tech that another depends on.
- The 6th citizen in each city is the first unhappy one (was 5th).
- Enabled risk of plague at cities with population greater than 4. Chances reduced by the buildings Aqueduct, Sewer System, Hospital, and the wonder Cure for Cancer.
- Added other random disasters: Earthquake (city on Hills), Fire (city larger than 8), Flood (city near Rivers), and Nuclear Accident (city with Nuclear Plant).
- Enabled culture points, produced in each city by wonders, and by scientific or religious buildings.
The culture accumulated by your nation increases the cost to bribe your units or incite your cities (up to +100%), and reduces the chances of civil war (up to -50%).
The culture accumulated by each city increases its resistance against actions of enemy agents (up to +50%).
- Enabled achievements, that may give extra culture: Metropolis (city size 20), Multicultural (2 nationalities), Literate (100% literacy), Land Ahoy (2nd continent), Entire Map Known, Spaceship Launch.
- Added new barbarian nation that controls hostile animal units (with low attack, up to 2), placed randomly at the start of the game. Storms placed on oceans can sink even Ironclads, so avoid ending the turn near them.
- Increased "AI Love" effect for AI players, in order to reduce the amount of wars between them.


OPTIONAL RULES:
---------------
- Every player starts with 1 free tech, 1 Settler, 1 Worker, 1 Explorer, and 1 Diplomat.
- Minimum distance between cities set to 3.
- Initial national border equal to city radius (2 tiles).
- Restricted the use of infrastructure (roads, railroads, and rivers) for enemy units.
- Unreachable units do not protect reachable ones.
- Occupy chance set to 100%: Units automatically move to the target tile if the attack is successful and ZoC rules allow the movement.
- When you get a new tech by treaty, conquest, or diplomatic mission, half of its cost is subtracted from your pool of research points. Teams do not share the research pool.
- If the pool of research points ends negative, and the negative points are greater than half the cost of the current research, then one random technology is lost, and only half of its value is restored to the research pool.
- Random period of anarchy when changing government (1 to 3 turns). The max number of turns is reduced depending on how many times any player has changed to this type of government before.


FOODBOX:
--------
- Foodbox size uniformed to even the population wasted when you build Settlers at larger cities (similar to civ3).
- Granary size is fixed to 10 Food for every city size.
- Cities with Pop <= 4 receive this granary effect for free, so they can create Settlers at best rate even without Granary. (This free granary effect helps the AI to build Settlers optimally).

# Granary effect for free when city grows to this city level.
FOODBOX = Foodbox size at that city level. (In brackets = Granary size).
SETTLER = Food needed to recover the population if you create a Settler at that city size. (In brackets = The same but with Granary).
NEW = This ruleset. OLD = Classic ruleset

TIP: In order to keep max growth, you should build the Granary before city grows larger than Pop 4 (same as Aqueduct at Pop 8, and Sewer System at Pop 16).
TIP: Optimal production of Settlers occurs at any city with Pop <= 4, or cities with Granary and Pop <= 6. 


TERRAIN:
--------
- Jungles receive 1 extra Production (1/1/0). Forest and Jungle can be mined to get +1 Production (Lumber).
- Tundras can be mined for +1 Production (instead of irrigated) and receive +1 Trade when roaded (up to 1/1/1).
- Swamps can be irrigated for +1 Food (to 2/0/0). Reduced Food bonus by 1 to Spice (on Swamp).
- Deserts with a river receive 1 extra Food (to boost growth at terrains like Nile flood), unless they have an Oasis.
- Hills receive 1 Production for free, and +2 from mines, same as civ3, (was 0 and +3). Mountains receive +2 Production from mines too (was +1).
- Cities can not be placed on Mountains (nor Glaciers). Mountains give extra vision range. Ground units starting the turn on unroaded Mountains receive a -1 penalty to movement (this way it is not so good for cavalry to end the turn on Mountains).
- The discovery of Refining allows to upgrade the mines placed on Desert, Tundra and Glacier to Oil Wells (+2 Production).
- Lake tiles receive for free +1 Food (2/0/2), but Harbours do not affect them. Lakes do not enable wonders that needs a coastal city.
- Deep ocean tiles require Supermarket (in addition to Harbour) to produce 1 extra Food, and they must be mined in order to take advantage of the production bonus from Offshore Platforms.
- Pollution may appear in Ocean tiles, and Transports can clean it without the need of Workers/Engineers. Oceans, Jungles and Forests are less affected by global warming.
- The only terrain transformations available (before the end of the tech tree) are: Jungle -> Swamp; and Plains -> Grassland -> Forest -> Plains.

- Added new resources, up to 3 per terrain: Incense (+3 trade on desert), Deer (+2 food on forest, while Pheasant now +1 food and +1 trade), Marble (+1 production and +1 trade on hills), Ivory (now on jungle, with 1 less trade), Seals (same bonuses as Ivory, but on glacier), Shellfish (+1 food and +1 trade on oceans and lakes), Salt (+1 production and +1 trade on coastal ocean), Horses (+2 production on plains, while Buffalo now +1 food and +1 production), Sugar (+2 food and +2 trade on swamp).
- There are now 6 resources on Grassland, with 3 different effects: Cattle or Corn (+1 food), Wool or Cotton (+1 production), Tea or Tobacco (+2 trade).
- There are also 4 extra strategic resources that can be used when certain tech is researched by the player (+2 production with the required tech): Niter (on plains or desert with Gunpowder), Rubber (on jungle, swamp or forest with Chemistry), Aluminum (on hills or tundra with Industrialization), Uranium (on mountains or glacier with Nuclear Fission).
- Luxury resources (Incense, Silk, Tea, Tobacco, Wine, Gems, Gold, Shellfish, Spice, Furs): +1 Luxury in cities linked by trade route.
- Food resources (Seals, Oasis, Pheasant, Deer, Cattle, Corn, Fruit, Fish, Whales, Wheat, Buffalo, Sugar, Game): +1 unit free of upkeep in cities linked by trade route.
- Production resources (Oil, Wool, Cotton, Coal, Marble, Ivory, Iron, Salt, Horse, Peat; Niter, Rubber, Aluminum, Uranium): +1 Production in cities linked by trade route.
- Recover resources (Horses, Ivory, Wood, Coal/Peat, Oil): halved effect of HP recover buildings in a city without the resource required by the unit (infantry units require a Hospital, wooded units require Lumber).
- Strategic resources (Horses, Ivory; Niter, Rubber, Aluminum, Uranium): +1 veteran level for certain units built in the city.
- All resources affect a bit the chances of plague, so they can be seen in the city UI. Increased risk for resources traded from other cities.

- No minimum city output (was 1/1/0). City central tile simply gets +1 Production.
This way, no matter the tile where you place your city, you never waste any resource (for example, with classic rules, a city placed over bonused Grassland was wasting the Production bonus).

F/P/T = Food/Production/Trade; (t) = turns
MAX1 = Irrigation/Mine/Road/Harbour; MAX2 = Farmland/Railroad/Oil Well.
* = Changes compared to classic ruleset. Most affected are Jungles, Swamps and Tundras.

TIP: The optimal tiles to place your initial cities are those with MAX output equal or greater than 2/1/1, mainly those with bonus resources or rivers. Hills and Plains are always good places for cities, as well as Flood Desert (desert with river), or bonused Grassland. The best defense comes from cities placed on Hills with river.


DEFENSE:
--------
- Halved the terrain defense bonuses, now more similar to civ3 values:

SDI Defense       -        -        -       +100%

- Units in Deep Ocean (or Ocean with a Naval Mine) receive a +50% defense bonus against sea units (except against Submarines).
- Every city of any size receives an inherent +50% defense bonus against all kinds of land units.
- Every city with Pop>8 receives an additional +50% defense bonus against both land and sea units.
- Effect of City Walls reduced from 200% to 100%, and cost reduced from 60 to 30.
- Great Wall wonder gives an additional +50% defense bonus against land units, and prevents the loss of population when a defending unit loses.

Total Defense = (UNIT DEFENSE) * (100+TERRAIN)/100 * (100+RIVER)/100 * (100+CITY+BASE)/100 * (100+FORTIFIED)/100 * (100+VETERAN)/100
(Same as classic rules).

EXAMPLE: Riflemen fortified in a Fortress, on Mountains, with a River, will get a total defense of 30 against land attacks:

         Riflemen: defense 4
         Fortified (+50%): 4 + 2 = 6
         In Fortress (+100%):      6 + 6 = 12
         On Mountains (+100%):             12 + 12 = 24
         With River (+25%):                          24 + 6 = 30.

EXAMPLE: Riflemen in a size 9 city, with Walls, on Hills, will get a total defense of 27 against land attacks:

         Fortified (+50%): 4 + 2 = 6
         On Hills (+50%):          6 + 3 = 9
         In City with Walls (+200%):       9 + 18 = 27.

- Added Fundamentalism (available with Theology), Tribal (available at start), Federation (available with Economics) and Fascism (available with Tactics).

- "Base Corruption\Waste": Modern governments cause less Trade Corruption, but more Wasted Production. The total % lost (Waste + Corruption) is equal for all governments.
- "Empire Size" (number of cities that start causing extra unhappiness): Modern governments have double size limit than his ancient counterpart. Empire Base Size is equal to Empire Step Size for every government.
- "Unit Upkeep": Tribal, Republic and Communism use the standard unit upkeep by Shields, while the other governments use upkeep by Gold (x2 Gold per unit for modern governments).
- "Free Units": Means units free of Gold\Shield upkeep and also free of military unhappiness. By default 2 free units per city.
- "Mil Unhappiness": Most governments are affected by military unhappiness due to units out of cities/fortresses (same as Republic in classic ruleset).
- "Martial Law": Max 3 units can apply martial law (was max 20 for Despotism and Anarchy).
- "Bribe\Incite": The cost to bribe your units or incite your cities are increased under some governments. Democracy and Federation are immune to incite actions.

- The output bonus of Palace (under Despotism and Monarchy) switched from Production to Gold.
- The bonus "+1 Trade" under Republic and Democracy does not affect oceanic tiles.
- Republic gets "Revolution when unhappy" effect. Federation gets "Has senate" effect. Democracy gets both effects.
- Tribal gets +1 content citizen in every city (but no martial law). Federation gets +2 Luxuries in every city. Communism cancels the bonus from Mysticism and Theology (to Temples and Cathedrals).
- Tribal and Fascism increase the chance of ground units getting the next veteran level after a battle.
- Spies built under Federation or Communism will start at the first veteran level.
- Under Democracy or Communism, Partisans appear around conquered cities if Guerilla Warfare has been researched by the player.
- Under Fascism or Communism, you do not pay upkeep for buildings that cost 1 Gold.
- Under Fascism, citizens of enemy nationality cause extra unhappiness in the city (one unhappy face for each 2 enemy citizens).
- Under Fundamentalism, you receive extra Gold from tithes (buildings that produce happiness), but -50% to Science.

TIP: There is some hurry to get Monarchy or Republic (or to build Pyramids), in order to avoid the initial penalty to output per tile. However, the Corruption and Waste are evened for all governments, so there are no big differences, and every government could be used at any technological age. The choice depends on the role of your civilization.


TECHS:
------
- Added new wonders: Mausoleum of Mausolos (available with Ceremonial Burial), and Statue of Zeus (available with Polytheism). Oracle of Delphi renamed to Temple of Artemis (in order to allow all 7 wonders).
- Moved Great Wall to Construction (was Masonry). Moved King Richard's Crusade to Chivalry, so it requires Monarchy and Knights. Women's Suffrage moved to Conscription, so it requires Democracy. Switched Darwin's Voyage and Eiffel Tower (Darwin was earlier than Eiffel). Shakespeare's Theatre available with Sanitation (was Medicine).

- Diplomats available with Alphabet (was Writing), and Migrants with Pottery, so every initial tech allows some unit or building.
- Coastal Defense moved to Navigation. The labels and icons for "Magnetism" and "Navigation" were switched, because compass was already used by historical Caravels, while sextants were not invented until the age of Galleons/Frigates.
- Construction requires Iron Working instead of Currency. This way, Iron Working is a prerequisite to build Frigates and Ironclads.
- Bridge Building merged to old Engineering in the tech tree. Added modern "Engineering" in the Industrial Ages that allows Destroyers (was Electricity) and Transports (was Industrialization), and it is required for Steel (Cruiser), Amphibious Warfare (Ports), and Combustion (Submarines).
- Explosives allows new terrain improvements: Naval Mines that damage adjacent sea units, and Canals to join oceans separated by no more than 2 land tiles.
- Battleship available with Mass Production instead of Automobile. Mfg Plant available with Plastics (was Robotics).
- Nuclear Fission requires Refrigeration, in order to delay the atomic age, and to force the AI to research farms. Communism requires Theology (Fundamentalism) instead of Philosophy, to encourage AI to research all governments.
- Fusion Power allows Engineers to perform terrain transformations. Redesigned so all useful alterations can be finished in 1 or 2 steps, and all effects from global warming can be reversibly with terraforming.

Special effects:
- Astronomy: Increases units vision when in Fortress.
- Invention: Halves upgrade cost of your units.
- Medicine: Land units (non wheeled) recover 2 HPs per turn, even without resting, except on Mountains, Glacier or Deep Ocean.
- Physics: Wheeled units and naval units recover 2 extra HPs per turn, except on Mountains, Glacier or Deep Ocean.
- Electricity: Allows irrigation without adjacent water, increases city vision radius, and improves the effect of Amphitheatres.
- Refining: Allows to upgrade mines to oil wells (+2 production) on Desert, Tundra and Glacier.
- Trade: Allows 1 trade route per city. Decreases one-time the waste of Production caused by distance to capital.
- The Corporation: Allows 2 trade routes per city. Decreases one-time the corruption of Trade caused by distance to capital.
- Labor Union: Engineers are built with one extra veteran level.

The techs, buildings, wonders and units are the same as civ2, but some requirements have been changed to improve a bit the historical accuracy, to encourage the use of every military unit, and to avoid units or wonders becoming obsolete too soon. The following is a list of some inaccuracies from classic tech tree that were addressed in the new tree:
- It was possible to research Pikemen before Phalanxs; Musketeers before Pikemen; Ironclads before Frigates; Destroyers before Ironclads; Armors before Artillery; Mech Infantry without Barracks III.
- Cathedrals did not require Construction nor Masonry. Ironclads and Eiffel Tower were available without Iron Working. Chivalry and Pikemen did not need Iron nor Bronze.
- Pottery was not needed to research Trade, Economics, Explosives, Invention, or Sanitation.
- Chemistry was not related to Atomic theory, Refrigeration, Gunpowder, Steam Engine, or Steel.
- Theory of Gravity did not need Physics, Invention, or even The Wheel, and it was not needed for Automobile, Robotics, or Miniaturization.
- Offshore Platforms did not require Refining, Combustion or Explosives. Miniaturization was not needed for Rocketry or Laser.

In the new tree, you are forced to research most of the ancient techs before you can research the modern ones, but overall, researching paths are similar to classic tree.


BUILDINGS:
----------
- Added Ecclesiastical Palace (available with Theology), that acts as a second center of government that lowers corruption and waste.
- Added Hospital (available with Medicine), that reduces -30% the chances of plague in the city (old effect of Medicine), and required by Barracks to recover damaged Land units.
- The effect of Barracks to recover damaged units is halved when the resources required by the unit are not available in the city. Naval units recover +25% HPs at cities with a Harbour (full recover with a Port) and the resource required by the unit.
- Aqueduct is cheaper near rivers or lakes. Sewer System is needed to grow larger than pop 16 (instead of 12). Each one reduces the chances of illness by -30%.
- Courthouse: Makes 1 citizen content, increases (+100%) the cost to incite the city to revolt, and halves any kind of waste (Trade, Production or Food).
Added new effect: Food wasted by distance to Palace = -1% Food each 2 tiles. For example, cities at distance 10 of the Palace lose -5% Food, so they lose -1 Food when their output reaches 20 Food per turn (noticeable with 10 Food per turn due to rounding effects).
- Granary halves the waste of Food caused by distance to Palace. Together with a Courthouse, it eliminates completely the waste of Food.
- Police Station: Makes 2 citizens content, and reduces unhappiness caused by 1 military unit.
- Science bonus by buildings (Library, University and Research Lab) restored to civ2 values (+50%).
- Production bonus by Factory and Mfg Plant reduced to +25% each (was +50%), so the Power Plants are as important as the Factories. Mfg Plants allows the construction of 2 units per turn. 
- Super Highways double the effect of Stock Exchange (+50% to Gold/Luxuries), and they produce extra Trade at tiles with roads but without farmlands.
- Doubled costs of all Spaceship parts. All them require Library, University, Research Lab and Factory present in the city in order to be built. 
- Reduced by one the gold upkeep of Aqueduct, Colosseum (renamed to Amphitheatre), University, Bank, Stock Exchange, Port Facility, SDI Defense, Factory and Mfg Plant.
- Pollution caused by population is increased by buildings instead of by techs:
Industrialization->Factory; Automobile->Highways; Plastics->Mfg Plant; Mass Production->Offshore platforms. 
- Adjusted the Pollution of all Power Plants, and increased building cost of Nuclear Plants:

               Cost  Upkeep  Production  Pollution(+Recycle)
Power plant    130   4       +25%/+50%   100%(50%)
Hydro plant    180   4       +25%/+50%   50% (25%)
(+Hoover Dam)  (=)  (=)         (=)      25% (0%)
Nuclear plant  240   2       +25%/+50%   50% (25%)
Solar plant    320   4       +25%/+50%   25% (0%)


UNITS:
------
- Settlers pop cost increased to 2 and removed the upkeep. New unit Migrants available to work, or to migrate 1 pop, they can't create cities and can be captured. Costs more similar to civ3:
Settlers:  pop_cost = 2, cost = 30, upkeep = 0
Migrants:  pop_cost = 1, cost = 10, upkeep = 0
Workers:   pop_cost = 0, cost = 20, upkeep = 1

- Non-military units now belongs to a new unit class ("Small Land") that can not capture cities, and does not create Zones of Control (ZOC) that would affect the movements of enemy units.
- Created a new unit class for Caravans and Freights ("Merchant") that doesn't get the unlimited movement from Maglev, and can be captured. Cost reduced from 50 to 30.
- Military "Land" units can capture enemy Migrants (as slaves) and Caravans/Freights (as loot).
- Wheeled units (new unit class "Big land") can't move to Mountains, Jungles and Swamps, unless they are traveling on a road. They do not get defensive bonuses from the terrain, can not perform pillage, and need Galleons or Transports to travel by sea.
- Units can establish embassies or investigate cities directly from boats without disembarking. Explorers can also perform those two actions, same as Diplomats. Increased vision range of Explorers and Partisans.
- Enabled ZOC for Sea units in Deep Ocean. Cargo boats and Submarines do not impose ZOC to enemy units. Air units can be used to ignore enemy ZOCs.
- All military infantry units can build fortresses. All worker units can build airbases, and can remove any terrain improvement.

- Added Elephants from civ2, available with Polytheism: (at/def/mov-hp,cost) = (3/2/2-10,30). Obsolete by Dragoons.
- Added Crusaders from civ2, available with Monotheism: (5/1/2-10,40). Obsolete by Dragoons. They do not cause military unhappiness.
- Added Fanatics from civ2, available with Guerrilla, under Fundamentalism government: (5/5/1-20,20). They cost 1 population, but do not cause unhappiness and do not need upkeep.

- Archers defense reduced to 1 (was 2), and cost to 20 (was 30). Legion cost reduced to 30 (was 40). This way the ratio Attack/Cost of ancient units is more even to Catapults.
- Pikemen changed to (2/3), cost to 30, and removed the doubled defense vs horses. Attack of Chariots increased to 4 (was 3). Defense of Knights increased to 3 (was 2). In order to encourage early use of cavalry.
- Alpine Troops changed to (7/4), and Partisan to (4/5). This way, Riflemen do not become obsolete as city defenders until Partisan or Marine are researched, and every modern infantry is somehow useful.
- Given Marine ability to Legion, Musketeer, and Rifleman. This way, one-tile islands can be assaulted early in game. Yet, the Marine unit is still the best offensive/defensive infantry.
- Trireme renamed to Galley. Caravel changed from (2/1) to (1/2), in order to encourage peaceful exploration of the seas in the age of discovery.
- Removed transport capability from Frigates, to force the use of Galleons. Reduced attack of Frigate and defense of Ironclad to 3 (were 4).
- Battleship hit points reduced to 30 (was 40), Ironclad and Submarine to 20 (was 30). Doubled the defense of Destroyers against Submarines. Now there is a Rock-paper-scissors relation between Destroyer-Cruiser-Submarine.
- All units that had Firepower 2 now have Firepower 1, in order to even the power of naval, air, and artillery units, and to simplify the mental calculation to compare them.
- Artillery and Howitzer receive the ability CityBuster, so their firepower is 1 in open field, and 2 against cities. Removed Ignore Walls for Howitzer (that would bypass the new city defense bonuses), and reduced movement to 1.
- Bombers and Helicopters receive the Bombarder ability: when they attack ground units, they can only damage (not kill) them, but damage every unit in a stack or city; and are never damaged while attacking. Note they have a normal attack against naval units (they still can kill or die).
Halved the attack so it is harder to bombard ground enemies successfully. Increased hit points so it is still possible to kill naval units.
- Air units can perform pillage (representing bombardment of infrastructure), and can be airlifted from a city with an Airport to another. Increased defense of all Air units, in order to discourage the use of ground units to protect them.
- Increased fuel of all Air units by one, in order to allow battles for air control. All Air unit lose 10% of HPs, like helicopters, when they end out of a city or airbase.
- Helicopters can carry 1 military Land unit, and can only be attacked by Fighters (with no extra attack bonuses), and by Missiles. Carriers can also transport military Land units.
- Cruise Missile no longer cause unhappiness, range increased to 16, and allowed to attack Air units.
- Nuclear weapons can be built with Nuclear Fission, but they have to start the turn in a city with an Airport in order to move (until the discovery of Rocketry).
- Reduced a bit some vision ranges. Most air and naval units see 2 tiles in horizontal/vertical, and 1 tile in diagonal (same as Explorers), except AEGIS cruiser and Stealth Fighter/Bomber that can see 2 tiles in diagonal too.
- Readjusted many costs so units with better stats are always more expensive. At the same time, modern units always get better ratio Att/Cost or Def/Cost.

WONDERS:
--------
Readjusted effects for most wonders. Restored all civ2 costs.
- Modified all effects that worked as if you had certain building in every city.
- Replaced every effect Make_Happy, Force_Content, and No_Unhappy, by additional Luxury in the central city tile. Else they would allow to avoid unhappiness caused by military units.
- Replaced effects that give a percentage bonus to Science output, by additional Science in the central city tile. This way, they do not multiply the effect of other wonders like Colossus, and it is not an advantage to build them all in the same city.
- Wonders become obsolete by techs researched by the owner (not affected by the researches of other players).
- Some wonders require certain building, or resource, in the city to be built.
- The bonuses to Science, Gold or Luxury are produced by the citizens (same as the bonuses to Trade or Shields), so they can be increased by other city improvements (same as the output of specialists).

FULL LIST OF WONDERS
(#) = Global effect, "Name", Cost, Requirements, Obsolescence, Effect

SINCE CIV2CIV3 v2.5:
--------------------
- New Fort and Airstrip bases, which must be built before Fortress and Airbase, respectively. Fortresses give more protection against land and sea units, while airbases are better against air units and missiles.
- The bases no longer prevent a whole unit stack from being lost when one defender dies, and they do not affect the national borders.
- Added Maglev (with Superconductors), which give infinite movement to land units (except Big Land and Merchant classes).
- Mountains get +2 Production from mines, same as Hills. The tech Refining allows to upgrade the mines placed on Desert, Tundra, and Glacier to Oil Wells (+2 Production).
- Deep Ocean tiles have to be mined in order to get the production bonus from Offshore Platforms.
- Adjusted effects of climate change. Ocean can no longer become Deep Ocean.
- Adjusted terrain transformations (available with Fusion Power). Designed so that all useful alterations can be finished in 1 or 2 steps, and all global warming effects can be reversed.
- The 50% science loss from Fundamentalism, and the 50% luxury loss from Anarchy, are now additive with other bonuses, rather than multiplicative.
- Construction now requires Iron Working, rather than Currency (so that Iron Working is a prerequisite for Frigates and Ironclads).
- Spaceship part cost doubled, so it is harder to achieve a space victory.
- Airplanes can spend an extra turn in the air, allowing more air-to-air battles. They lose 10% of hitpoints every turn when in the air, like Helicopters.
- Cruise Missiles can target airplanes, and have an increased range of 16 (greater than the movement of Stealth Fighters).

- Enabled tired attack, so units that attack with less than one movement point have reduced attack strength.
- Big Land class units may kill citizens when attacking a city, but the rest of land units may not.
- Caravans and Freights no longer require roads to move. Removed the one time trade revenues. They can help allies to build wonder. Cost reduced from 50 to 30.
- Units with cost of population do not pay upkeep of Shields or Gold: Settlers, Migrants and Fanatics.
- Carriers can transport units of Land class (same units as Helicopters).
- Establish Embassy and Investigate City actions can be done directly from a boat. Explorers can also perform those two actions, like Diplomats. Cost of Explorers restored to 30.
- Increased vision range of Explorers and Partisans. Partisan no longer obsoletes the Explorer.
- New building Ecclesiastical Palace (available with Theology), which acts as a second center of government.
- Great Wonders are now only obsoleted when the owner learns a certain technology, not when any player does.
- City center tiles are no longer guaranteed a minimum of 1 food (this only affects Desert tiles, and only if a mine is built on them). City centers get automatic roads, even on rivers without knowledge of Bridge Building.


SINCE CIV2CIV3 v2.6:
--------------------
- Enabled national trade routes again (without min distance), that spread the effects of bonus resources, though with halved revenues. It is not possible to create trade routes with foreign cities unless they are allies or on the same team. Each city can establish 1 trade route (2 after the discovery of The Corporation). 
x- Disabled Tech Leakage: technologies cost the same even if already discovered by other nations, and Embassies no longer affect the research costs. Tech cost factor reduced from x3 to x2.
- When you get a new tech by treaty, conquest, or diplomatic mission, half of its cost is subtracted from your research pool.
- You do not lose a technology due to negative research pool unless the negative points are greater than half the cost of your current research.
- Enabled culture points, produced in each city by wonders, and by scientific or religious buildings. Enabled achievements, that may give extra culture.
- National culture increases the cost to bribe your units or incite your cities (up to +100%), and reduces the chances of civil war (up to -50%). The culture of each city increases its resistance against actions of enemy agents (up to +50%).
- Immunity against bribe actions (under Republic or Democracy) replaced by increased costs (+100%). Most governments (except Despotism and Monarchy) get these increased costs against bribe and incite actions too.
- Effect of Courthouse against incite actions fixed to +100%. Replaced the lower cost of empty cities, by an additional +100% when not empty.

x- Tech Explosives allows new terrain improvements: Naval Mines that damage adjacent sea units, and Canals to join oceans separated by no more than 2 land tiles.
x- Tech Medicine allows non wheeled land units to recover 2 HPs per turn, even without resting. Physics allow the same for wheeled and naval units.
- Tech Labor Union allows cities to build engineers with one extra veteran level.
x- Added new building: Hospital (available with Medicine), that reduces -30% the chances of plague in the city (old effect of Medicine), and required by Barracks to recover damaged Land units.
x- Added new government: Fascism (available with Tactics, which requires Leadership and Conscription).
- Halved the chances of civil war for every government. Switched empire size of Tribal (now 12) and Monarchy (now 14).
- Tribal gets +1 content per city, instead of martial law. Federation gets +2 Luxury per city.
- Appearance of Partisans in conquered cities requires the knowledge of Guerrilla Warfare by the owner.
- Readjusted effect of wonders "Statue of Zeus" (+2 gold/shield for upkeep of units), "King Richard's Crusade" (bonus to empire size and veteran chance, obsolete by Radio), "Mausoleum of Mausolos" (obsolete by Communism), "Copernicus' Observatory" (obsolete by Rocketry), "Great Library" (+1 Science per Library for the owner, obsolete by Computers), "Isaac Newton's College" (+2 Science per University for the owner), "Internet" (+3 Science per Research Lab for the owner, and tech parasite effect), "A.Smith's Trading Co" (+2 Gold per Stock Exchange for the owner, +1 trade route in the city), "Statue of Liberty" (+1 move for Merchants and Diplomats), "Marco Polo's Embassy" (free embassies, +1 trade route in the city, obsolete by The Corporation), "United Nations" (veteran Diplomats in the city, free embassies for every player), "Hoover Dam" (requires Hydro Plant, double bonus to production).
- The following wonders now affect only to cities located on the same continent: "Great Wall" (now obsolete by Flight), "Sun Tzu's War Academy", "Eiffel Tower" (now enables appearance of Partisans), and "J.S. Bach's Cathedral".

x- Increased by one the number of veterancy levels, with effects: 100%, 125%, 150%, 175% and 200%. Engineers up to 150%.
- All military infantry units can build fortresses. All worker units can build airbases, and can remove any terrain improvement.
- Trireme replaced by Galley, that can no longer navigate rivers, and become obsolete by Caravels.
- Enabled ZOC for Sea units in Deep Ocean. Cargo boats and Submarines do not impose ZOC to enemy units. Air units can be used to ignore enemy ZOCs.
- Defense bonus +50% in Deep Ocean (or Ocean with a Naval Mine) against sea units (except against submarines). Reduced a bit the cost of several naval units. Submarine defense changed to 4 (was 5), and doubled against air attacks.
- Nuclear weapons have to start the turn in a city with an Airport in order to move (until the discovery of Rocketry).
- Buildings with bonus to defense are visible by others (middle click on the city).
- Reduced a bit some vision ranges. Most air and naval units see 2 tiles in horizontal/vertical, and 1 tile in diagonal (same as Explorers), except AEGIS cruiser and Stealth Fighter/Bomber that can see 2 tiles in diagonal too.

x- Added new barbarian nation that controls hostile animal units, placed randomly at the start of the game.
x- Forest and Jungle can be mined to get Lumber (+1 production). Forests can no longer be transformed to Grassland directly (now Forest to Plains, and Plains to Grassland).
x- Added new resources, up to 3 per terrain: Incense (+3 trade on desert), Deer (+2 food on forest, while Pheasant now +1 food and +1 trade), Marble (+1 production and +1 trade on hills), Ivory (now on jungle, with 1 less trade), Seals (same bonuses as Ivory, but on glacier), Shellfish (+1 food and +1 trade on oceans and lakes), Salt (+1 production and +1 trade on coastal ocean), Horses (+2 production on plains, while Buffalo now +1 food and +1 production), Sugar (+2 food and +2 trade on swamp).
x- There are now 6 resources on Grassland, with 3 different effects: Cattle or Corn (+1 food), Wool or Cotton (+1 production), Tea or Tobacco (+2 trade).
x- There are also 4 extra strategic resources that can be used when certain tech is researched by the player (+2 production with the required tech): Niter (on plains or desert with Gunpowder), Rubber (on jungle, swamp or forest with Chemistry), Aluminum (on hills or tundra with Industrialization), Uranium (on mountains or glacier with Nuclear Fission).
x- Luxury resources (Incense, Silk, Tea, Tobacco, Wine, Gems, Gold, Shellfish, Spice, Furs): +1 Luxury in cities linked by trade route.
x- Food resources (Seals, Oasis, Pheasant, Deer, Cattle, Corn, Fruit, Fish, Whales, Wheat, Buffalo, Sugar, Game): +1 unit free of upkeep in cities linked by trade route.
x- Production resources (Oil, Wool, Cotton, Coal, Marble, Ivory, Iron, Salt, Horse, Peat; Niter, Rubber, Aluminum, Uranium): +1 Production in cities linked by trade route.
x- Recover resources (Hospital, Wood, Coal/Peat, Oil): halved effect of HP recover buildings in a city without the resource required by the unit (land units require a Hospital, wooded units require Lumber).
x- Strategic resources (Horses, Ivory; Niter, Rubber, Aluminum, Uranium): +1 veteran level for certain units built in the city.
x- All resources affect a bit the chances of plague, so they can be seen in the city UI. Resources traded from other cities increase the risk of plague.
x- Wonder Apollo Program requires Aluminum available in the city. Manhattan Project requires Uranium. The bonus to production of Nuclear Plants is doubled in cities with available Uranium.
x- Deep ocean tiles require Supermarket (in addition to Harbour) to produce 1 extra Food. Naval units recover +25% HPs at cities with a Harbour and the resource required by the unit.
x- Earth scenario: Added Natural Wonders, which give +3 luxuries in the tile where they are placed, and increase a bit the risk of natural disasters. Marked with a text label, and a flag icon.
